This is a straight-forward, no-frills secure(ish) password generator.

## Installation

This is just an HTML file, a CSS file, a javascript file, and an image files. No installation is required.

## Usage

Simply click the button and answer the questions. Right now the default buttons are being used for the prompt input, so click "OK" for "YES" and "CANCEL" for "NO." There are a few invalid choices so I've done my best to make it clear if a wrong one is chosen.

## Contributing

Please contact me if you have any suggestions. Either things that need to be changed or removed, or elements that need to be added.

If you think it should be scrapped and started over from scratch you could suggest that too, but it wouldn't be very helpful without telling me exactly why it doesn't work.

## Current iteration

0.1  The html, css, and Javascript seem to be functioning properly. This is the bare minimum I'd consider for the first iteration. 


## Future Development Plans

- Improve aesthetics by adjusting the input window so the buttons read "YES" and "NO" instead of "OKAY" and "CANCEL"

- Figure out why the program only works once per refresh. On a clean page load it runs once, but each subsequent time it outputs the original password.

- Improve UI by making it so the user can input a bad value but they won't have to start over again. Right now if the user tries to input an invalid choice it just cancels the program and sends them back to the start.

- Improve UI by adding checkboxes to bypass the bulky and unweidly prompts. Just check the boxes, maybe add a number into an input field, click a button and enjoy your new secure password.
